print(Age)  ##it will print age of vikas , basically age is a integer.
print(type(Age))  ## type is used to know which data type is . Output : <class 'int'>

print (height)       ## 5.8
print(type(height))  ## <class 'float'>



         #Arithmatic operations

print (A+B)      # 10 + 20 =30 addition
print (A-B)      # 10 - 20 = -10 subtraction
print (A*B)      # 10 * 20 = 200 multiplication
print (A/B)      # 10 / 20 = 0.5 division
print (A//B)     # 10 // 20 = 0 because it used to ignore the decimal. it will give absolute value.
print (A**B)     # 10 ** 20  = 10000000000 .it is used to get power of value.10 to the power of 20 (10^20) is a very large number, equal to 1 followed by 20 zeros. It can be written as 100,000,000,000,000,000,000. 
print (A % B)    # 10 % 20
